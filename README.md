Basic puppet iptables module
============================

This puppet module installs an iptables ruleset on a host.

Rulesets are written in the format generated by the iptables-save command.  This means you can write your ruleset interactively, then export it using  iptables-save and have puppet restore the result automatically.

Usage:
------

1. Place the 'iptables/' folder in your modules directory
1. Put your ruleset in the 'iptables/templates/' folder in a file named &lt;ruleset&gt;.iptables-save
1. Load the '''iptables''' class with parameters in your host manifest

  `class {
   "iptables" :
     ruleset_name => "masquerade-example.iptables-save" ;
}`

  An example ruleset is included in the source which loads a masquerade
  rule into the nat table.
1. An optional boolean parameter 'ip_forward' can be set to true (default: false) that will enable ip-forwarding on the host

Caveats:
--------

- Designed for Debian/Ubuntu distributions and tested on Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10.)  Some modifications would be needed for it to work on Red Hat derived distros.

- Does NOT enforce a ruleset on a running host.  The ruleset is installed
  into the iptables-persistent service and loaded only at installation time
  and then by iptables-persistent on subsequent boots.
